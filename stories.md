# Little Shop of Orders, v2
BE Mod 2 Week 4/5 Group Project



## User Roles

1. Visitor - this type of user is anonymously browsing our site and is not logged in
2. Registered User - this user is registered and logged in to the application while performing their work; can place items in a cart and create an order
3. Merchant User - a registered user who is also has access to merchant data and operations; user is logged in to perform their work
4. Admin User - a registered user (but cannot also be a merchant) who has "superuser" access to all areas of the application; user is logged in to perform their work

## Order Status

1. 'pending' means a user has placed items in a cart and "checked out" to create an order, merchants may or may not have fulfilled any items yet
2. 'packaged' means all merchants have fulfilled their items for the order, and has been packaged and ready to ship
3. 'shipped' means an admin has 'shipped' a package and can no longer be cancelled by a user
4. 'cancelled' only 'pending' and 'packaged' orders can be cancelled


## Not Everything can be FULLY Deleted

In the user stories, we talk about "CRUD" functionality. However, it's rare in a real production system to ever truly delete content, and instead we typically just 'enable' or 'disable' content. Users, items and orders can be 'enabled' or 'disabled' which blocks functionality (users whose accounts are disabled should not be allowed to log in, items which are disabled cannot be ordered, orders which are disabled cannot be processed, and so on).

Disabled content should also be restricted from showing up in the statistics pages. For example: if an item is disabled, it should not appear in a list of "popular items".

Be careful to watch out for which stories allow full deletion of content, and restrictions on when they apply.

User Story 1, Deploy your application to Heroku

As a visitor or user of the site
I will perform all user stories
By visiting the application on Heroku.
Localhost is fine for development, but
the application must be hosted on Heroku.
```

---

## Navigation
This series of stories will set up a navigation bar at the top of the screen and present links and information to users of your site.

There is no requirement that the nav bar be "locked" to the top of the screen.

### Completion of these stories will encompass the following ideas:

- the navigation is built into app/views/layouts/application.html.erb or loaded into that file as a partial
- you write a single set of tests that simply click on a link and expect that your current path is what you expect to see
- your nav tests don't need to check any content on the pages, just that current_path is what you expect

You will need to set up some basic routing and empty controller actions and empty action view files.

## Items
This is the main "catalog" page of the entire site where users will start their e-commerce experience. Visitors to the site, and regular users, will be able to view an index page of all items available for purchase and some basic statistics. Each item will also have a "show" page where more information is shown.

```
[ ] done

User Story 14, Items Index Page

As any kind of user on the system
I can visit the items catalog ("/items")

Each item will display the following information:

- the merchant name who sells the item

---

## User Profile Page
When a user who is not a merchant nor an admin logs into the system, they are taken to a profile page under a route of "/profile".

### Admins can act on behalf of users
Admin users can access a namespaced route of "/admin/users" to see an index page  of all non-merchant/non-admin users, and from there see each user. This will allow the admin to perform every action on a user's account that the user themselves can perform. Admin users can also "upgrade" a user account to become a merchant account.

```

---

## Shopping Cart and Checkout
This is what this app is all about: how a user can put things in a shopping cart and check out, creating an order in the process.

### Visitors and Regular Users only
Merchants and Admin users cannot order items. This will cause a conflict in the project if an admin upgrades a user to a merchant and that user had previous orders of their own. We're not going to worry about this conflict.

```

---

## User Order Show Page
The show page template for an order can be shared between users, merchants and admins to DRY up our presentation logic. They will operate through separate controllers, though.

### User Control
- Users can cancel an order if an admin has not "shipped" that order
- When an order is cancelled, any fulfilled items have their inventory returned to their respective merchants

### Merchant Control
- Merchants only see items in the order that are sold by that merchant
- Items from other merchants are hidden

### Admin Control
- Admins can cancel an order on behalf of a user
- Admins can fulfill items on order on behalf of a merchant

### Admins can act on behalf of merchants
Admin users will see more information on the "/merchants" route that all users see. For example, on this page, an admin user can navigate to each merchant's dashboard under a route like "/admin/merchants/7". This will allow the admin to perform every action that the merchant themselves can perform. Admin users can also "downgrade" a merchant account to become a user account.

## Merchant Items
Merchants need CRUD functionality for items in the database. These stories will work through the management of items. These routes should be namespaced like "/dashboard/items" and "/dashboard/items/6" and so on. Merchants can disable items so they are no longer for sale but stay in the database so orders are still handled properly. Merchants can fully delete items if nobody has ever ordered it.

### Admin functionality
Admin users share all management functionality, but the routes will be much longer, like "/admin/merchants/8/items" and "/admin/merchants/8/items/6" and so on.

## Merchant Order Fulfillment
Merchants must "fulfill" each ordered item for users. They will visit an order show page which will allow them to mark each item as fulfilled. Once every merchant marks their items for an order as "fulfilled" then the whole order switches its status to "shipped". Merchants cannot fulfill items in an order if they do not have enough inventory in stock. If a user cancels an order after a merchant has fulfilled an item, the quantity of that item is returned to the merchant.

### Admin functionality
Admins can fulfill items in an order on behalf of a merchant.
